# 🐍 Python Foundations

My programming work while pursuing an Online BCA at Manipal University Jaipur, built alongside a self-directed 3-year roadmap toward becoming an AI/ML engineer. Started August 2026.

This repository documents my progression from basic terminal scripts to object-oriented programming, local data science pipelines, classical machine learning models, local LLM/image inference engines, and live cloud-deployed web applications.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3, Flask, SQLite, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, REST APIs (`requests`), Local Inference (`llama.cpp` / GGUF / Ollama), HTML/CSS, Git, Render (Cloud Hosting).

## 🤖 Local AI & Machine Learning Systems

### 1. Local AI Decision Router & Code Engine (`LLM/`)
* **What it does:** A lightweight local inference server built with PyTorch and FastAPI running on a local RTX 5050. It routes developer tasks and code refactoring workflows through quantized `Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct` (GGUF Q4_K_M) using dedicated API endpoints (`/v1/choice`, `/v1/generate_code`) with an expanded 16k context window.
* **Why I built it:** To master local GPU resource allocation, ChatML token structures, and local model quantization without relying on cloud APIs. Downsized from 7B to an optimized 3B Coder model to maximize inference speed and VRAM overhead for multi-stage retrieval workflows.
* **What I'd do differently:** Implement token streaming via Server-Sent Events (SSE) and hook into a local vector store for codebase-wide RAG retrieval.

### 2. Local Image Generation Pipeline
* **What it does:** An isolated, local diffusion pipeline running Fooocus and SDXL Lightning checkpoints on the RTX 5050 to generate high-resolution $1024 \times 1024$ image assets in 4–8 sampling steps.
* **Why I built it:** To benchmark local latent diffusion performance and explore offline multimodal generation workflows alongside the core text LLM server.

### 3. California Housing Price Predictor (Year 1 Capstone)
* **What it does:** An end-to-end data science pipeline (`housing_eda.py`) that loads geospatial housing data, visualizes price clusters using Matplotlib mapping, and trains a Scikit-Learn Linear Regression algorithm. Performance is evaluated mathematically using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
* **Why I built it:** To graduate from basic binary classification to continuous regression, satisfying my Year 1 Capstone requirement by handling advanced feature correlation and descriptive statistics.
* **What I'd do differently:** Swap the Linear Regression model for an ensemble Random Forest Regressor to capture non-linear geographical interactions.

## 🌐 Live Cloud Applications
*These full-stack web applications were built using Flask, styled with HTML/CSS, backed by SQLite databases, and deployed live to the public internet via Render.*

### 1. Financial Expense Tracker ([Live Demo](https://financial-expense-tracker-55kv.onrender.com))
* **What it does:** A production-ready financial dashboard that captures user expenses via HTML forms, permanently stores them in a cloud SQLite database, and dynamically calculates totals using Pandas (`df['amount'].sum()`).
* **Why I built it:** To synthesize database architecture (with automatic `init_db()` table generation), backend computation, and automated cloud deployment via GitHub CI/CD into a cohesive product.
* **What I'd do differently:** Group expenses by category (`.groupby()`) and render visual breakdowns directly on the frontend.

### 2. Global Weather App ([Live Demo](https://global-weather-app-uv6x.onrender.com))
* **What it does:** A cloud-deployed web app chaining two Open-Meteo REST APIs. It intercepts city searches, queries a Geocoding API to resolve coordinates, routes those into a Forecast API, and renders live temperatures on a dark-mode frontend.
* **Why I built it:** To transition from local datasets to external third-party API integration with dynamic query handling and URL injection. Initial testing monitored Tokyo conditions ahead of my first step to Japan.
* **What I'd do differently:** Add a 5-day forecast carousel below the live reading.

### 3. Client Data Dashboard
* **What it does:** A web application running on Flask connected to a local SQLite database (`client_data.db`) executing full CRUD operations with dynamic HTML table rendering.
* **Why I built it:** To learn dynamic URL parameter routing (`@app.route`) and HTTP request parsing (`POST`).
* **What I'd do differently:** Implement session-based authentication to guard administrative mutations.

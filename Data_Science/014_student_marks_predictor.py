# X (Features) must be a 2D array, which is why we use .reshape(-1, 1)
# y (Target) is just a standard 1D array

# 3. Training the Model (Fit)
# This is where the AI actually "learns" the relationship between hours and marks

# Let's ask the model what score a student will get if they study for 7.5 hours
